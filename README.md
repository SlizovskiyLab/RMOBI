# RMOBI: a Network Framework for Tracking Resistome-Mobilome Colocalization Across Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Cohorts 
![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-orange.svg)

RMOBI is a web-based visualization framework designed for constructing and analyzing large-scale heterogeneous temporal networks of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) across fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) phases. The system consists of two main components:

## 1. C++ Backend for Graph Construction and Analysis

RMOBI’s core engine is implemented in C++, where it processes colocalization data, models and builds heterogeneous temporal networks.
The backend models both colocalization edges and temporal edges, capturing how ARG–MGE relationships change across donor, pre-FMT, and post-FMT phases.
All results including nodes, metadata, and network structure are exported as clean, structured JSON files.

1. Efficient C++ implementation for constructing heterogeneous temporal graphs.
2. Produces structured CSV files that summarize Disease specific, MGE group and temporal dynamics of colocalizations before and after FMT.
3. Fully documented workflow and configuration examples for reproducibility.
   
## 2. Web-Based Visualization Frontend (D3.js, Hosted on GitHub Pages)

The JSON files generated by the C++ backend are visualized through an interactive D3.js interface.
This frontend is deployed and served using GitHub Pages, making RMOBI easy to access from any browser without additional setup.

The visualization module enables users to:

1. Interactive D3.js visualization with real time filtering and multi phase exploration.
2. Filter by disease type, patient phase, MGE group, or drill down to individual ARG/MGE nodes.
3. Export network visualizations as SVG files for publication or downstream analysis.

Compare donor, pre-FMT, and post-FMT temporal dynamics

Filter nodes and edges based on biological or clinical criteria

Analyze emergence, persistence, or loss of ARG–MGE colocalizations over time

Together, RMOBI provides a complete pipeline—from computational graph generation in C++ to intuitive, browser-based exploration via GitHub Pages.
